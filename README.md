# Earn-A-Fun-Fact-EAFF
 I love learning random, useless facts to spew in kahoots, so why not make a game out of it?!
 Series of games and challenges like tic-tac-toe and hangman with the end result of "earning a fun fact". You do not simply learn a new fun fact, you have to beat the games and earn the best possible reward... knowledge.
